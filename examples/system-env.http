# Example: Using System Environment Variables

# You can use system environment variables with $VAR or ${VAR} syntax
# These are read from your shell environment (e.g., $HOME, $USER, $PATH)

### GET with system environment variable
# Uses $USER from system environment
GET https://httpbin.org/get?user=$USER

### POST with multiple system variables
POST https://httpbin.org/post
Content-Type: application/json
X-User: $USER
X-Home: ${HOME}

{
  "user": "$USER",
  "home": "${HOME}",
  "shell": "$SHELL"
}

### Combining system vars and custom vars
@apiKey = my-secret-key
@endpoint = /api/v1

# Use {{endpoint}} for user-defined variable, $USER for system variable
GET https://httpbin.org{{endpoint}}
Authorization: Bearer {{apiKey}}
X-User: $USER

### Using environment-specific variables
# Set these in your shell:
# export API_ENV=production
# export API_TOKEN=prod-token-123

GET https://httpbin.org/headers
X-Environment: $API_ENV
Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN

### Mixed variable types
@baseUrl = https://api.example.com

POST {{baseUrl}}/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "$USER",
  "apiUrl": "{{baseUrl}}",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01"
}
